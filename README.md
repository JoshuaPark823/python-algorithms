# Collection of Algorithmic Solutions written in Python3

## Structure
- At the top of each file, the problem's prompt, example outputs, and constraints/restrictions will be posted as a comment.
- Following the constraints, solution is written below.
- Time complexity will be included in the commit message.

## Purpose
- To gain further proficiency with algos and data structures.
- To gain further proficiency with time & space complexity optimization.

## Notable Implementations
- reverse_int.py: </br>
</br>Faster than 60% of all other Python3 submissions. Achieved this by using a HashTable to store the individual digits as index:digit  pairs. By taking advantage of the HashTable's constant lookup time I managed to keep the runtime pretty low although space complexity took a small hit.

## Major Bugs
- None thus far.
